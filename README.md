# Short-Cut MSE for Antarctic Krill â€“ WAP

This project implements a **short-cut Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)** to test the robustness of the **fixed TAC rule (145,000 t/year)** currently used by **CCAMLR** for Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP).

The approach is adapted from the work of **Henning Winker (GFCM)** on **Blackspot seabream**, specifically his framework for shortcut MSEs in sex-structured models.

---

## Overview

- Simulates **true stock dynamics** using an operating model (OM).
- Emulates **assessment outcomes** ($SSB$, $F$) with error to derive TAC via the HCR.
- Avoids yearly re-fitting of the assessment model, reducing complexity and computation.
